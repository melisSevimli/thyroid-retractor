# Risk Management Plan - Thyroid Retractor Project

## Identified Risks
| Risk                                   | Impact       | Mitigation Strategy                     |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Prototype printing failure             | Medium       | Allow buffer time; have backup printer access |
| Lack of surgeon availability for feedback | High        | Schedule appointments early; have multiple surgeons contacted |
| CAD model not fitting surgical needs    | High         | Frequent early reviews with clinical advisors |
| Material unsuitable for sterilization   | Medium       | Choose sterilization-safe 3D printing materials |
| Delays due to technical learning curves | Medium       | Parallel task execution; seek online tutorials |

## Contingency Plan
If the initial prototype is non-functional, a second version will be immediately designed and printed within 5 working days.
