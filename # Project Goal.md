# Project Goal

Our project aims to design, prototype, and evaluate an innovative surgical retractor specifically optimized for thyroidectomy procedures.  
The retractor will improve surgical field visibility, minimize tissue trauma, and allow for more ergonomic use during thyroid surgeries.  
This project combines medical device engineering principles with clinical feedback to create a functional and user-centered solution.
