# Testing Plan - Thyroid Retractor Project

## Testing Phases
1. **Prototype Testing:**
   - Physical stress tests (manual pulling, bending)
   - Fit simulation on thyroidectomy surgical models

2. **Surgeon Feedback Testing:**
   - Usability assessment from 2-3 surgeons
   - Collect structured feedback (survey form)

3. **Design Refinement:**
   - Adjust based on feedback
   - Re-test modified design

## Acceptance Criteria
- Prototype remains intact under simulated surgical forces.
- Surgeons rate usability as â‰¥ 4 out of 5.
- Setup time remains below 3 minutes.

## Tools/Equipment Needed
- 3D printed prototype
- Surgical model or dummy
- Feedback survey form
